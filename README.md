Final project code(recommend.py) The program basically interacts with users in command lines. First, it will ask whether to start searching, if we type yes, we can begin searching and if we type no, it will prompt bye and terminate the program. The next step is giving the program what we want to search. The all data include zep cleaning products so we can type "Men's", "Women's" or any other key words we want to search. If there is no match, it will ask for another input again. Next, we will follow the instruction to give our price range, least rate we can accept, least rating counts we can accept to the program. Then, it would tell us how many matches we can get. Furthermore, to give the most precise suggestion, the program will ask for the top priority of user, including price most, price least, rate most, rate least and so on. However, if there is no match, it will ask the user rerun the code with larger range.

Finally, it will present the product name, its URL link and a picture crawling from product page.
